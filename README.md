# Random Precise Number Generator
 Generates a random number within a range that contains decimal values.

## Future updates
 - I'll make it so you can just download the .exe file in folder x64 and just run that next to a config file where you can specify all the bounds of the number you want to generate

### For now 
- you'll have to make a seperate visual studio project and copy and paste everything inside the .cpp file and run your code that way :)
